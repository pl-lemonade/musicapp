# ðŸŽµ Musica (unofficial)

*Musica (unofficial) will be a free alternative to the popular music streaming service Spotify, prioritizing free features, ease of use, and customization. I acknowledge Soundbound as an excellent alternative to Spotify and fully support its developer. This project is aimed at enhancing my coding skills, and I have no plans to distribute it or provide updates or bug fixes after its release.*

*The source code and an executable .exe file will be available for download once the project is complete.*

*Currently progress has not yet been started nor will it for quite a bit, most likely [IdleMonitor](https://github.com/pl-lemonade/IdleMonitor) will be prioritized over this project for now.*
